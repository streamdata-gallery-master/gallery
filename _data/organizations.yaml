  description: The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and

    Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you control
    the encryption keys and cryptographic operations performed by the HSM.AWS and
    AWS Marketplace partners offer a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive
    data within the AWS platform, but for applications and data subject to rigorous
    contractual or regulatory requirements for managing cryptographic keys, additional
    protection is sometimes necessary. Until now, your only option was to store the
    sensitive data (or the encryption keys protecting the sensitive data) in your
    on-premises datacenters. Unfortunately, this either prevented you from migrating
    these applications to the cloud or significantly slowed their performance. The
    AWS CloudHSM service allows you to protect your encryption keys within HSMs designed
    and validated to government standards for secure key management. You can securely
    generate, store, and manage the cryptographic keys used for data encryption such
    that they are accessible only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply with strict
    key management requirements without sacrificing application performance.The AWS
    CloudHSM service works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances
    are provisioned inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify, providing
    simple and private network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
    instances. Placing CloudHSM instances near your EC2 instances decreases network
    latency, which can improve application performance. AWS provides dedicated and
    exclusive (single tenant) access to CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS
    customers. Available in multiple Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM
    allows you to add secure and durable key storage to your applications.

  description: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name
    System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an
    extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications
    by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1
    that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant
    with IPv6 as well.Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure
    running in AWS &ndash; such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load
    balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets &ndash; and can also be used to route users to
    infrastructure outside of AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health
    checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health
    of your application and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy
    for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including
    Latency Based Routing, Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin&mdash;all of which can
    be combined with DNS Failover in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant
    architectures. Using Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow&rsquo;s simple visual editor,
    you can easily manage how your end-users are routed to your application&rsquo;s
    endpoints&mdash;whether in a single AWS region or distributed around the globe.
    Amazon Route 53 also offers Domain Name Registration &ndash; you can purchase
    and manage domain names such as example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically
    configure DNS settings for your domains.
